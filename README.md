## About YellowStore

YellowStore is an app that serves as a storefront to buy and sell goods.
In this app, users can register to create their own “store” in a couple minutes. In this store, products can be added and those items are then displayed in their own storefront. Here, any potential customer is able to look at the items and the details that come along with them.
Users can search either by product categories or product name.
In order to purchase any products, the user would have to contact the seller:
 - Contact info is displayed for the user (email, phone number, location).
 - The seller can be directly contacted via email.
Overall, YellowStore serves as a virtual store that allows anyone to upload their own products to sell. This gives anyone a chance to become an entrepreneur!
